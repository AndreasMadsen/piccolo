### Experimental

This project is highly experimental there is not even a documented API yet. Before
that can happen design issues need to be solved. If you which be involved the
design process, you can join an IRC at `#piccolo` (freenodes).

When the major design is cleared discussion issues will be opened. But for now
piccolo is moving to rapidly for that.
