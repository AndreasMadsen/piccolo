### The future

Piccolo is highly experimental but is a working framework since
[f666964fc](/AndreasMadsen/piccolo/commit/f666964fcee2c604ebbec0ab8574e1d32a26f9a3).
However there is a long way to go before it becomes mainstrem for most developers
and useful in a production environment.

The plan is that piccolo 1.0.0 will be an useful framework with a well defined API,
documentation, examples and works across all used browsers. The todo list exists as
a collection of issues, but you are welcome to open your own requests issues. Any
discussion about isomorphism itself should be on `#piccolo` (freenodes) or some other
channel.
